# the_book_of_life_test
A small, fun pet project of mine, inspired by a reddit thread I read a couple of years ago, where everyone at the age of 13,
must meet "The Consultant" and choose choices that will dictate how the rest of his life will unfold. It's a very
exaggerated way of showing the Butterfly Effect, coupled with the thought of how every choice we make affects our lives.

I'm mostly just using jQuery and intend to really flesh out the CSS after the javascript portion is done.
